Test project to use when working through the [setup docs](https://github.com/saud-learning-services/instructions-and-other-templates).

## Details

- make sure you paste your CANVAS API token into the `.env`
- if everything is setup correctly you should see an output like the following

<div>
    <img src="images/test-output.png" alt="Logo" width="350">
</div>

(instead displaying _your_ first name as it appears on Canvas)
