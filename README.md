# üë∑  Setup Test

> - name: setup-test
> - ops-run-with: jupyter
> - python>=3.8
> - canvasapi>=2.0.0
> - supports universal environment üåé

## Summary 
Test project to use when working through the [setup docs](https://github.com/saud-learning-services/instructions-and-other-templates).

## Input
You will need to give this tool an active Canvas API token for it to work. There are two methods of doing this (we recommend getting familiar with both):
  
a. Set your token to the `CANVAS_API_TOKEN` field in the `.env` file (replace {your-token-here}, including the brackets)

> `CANVAS_API_TOKEN={your-token-here}` 
becomes
> `CANVAS_API_TOKEN=fdfjskSDFj3343jkasdaA...`

or

  b. Delete the `.env` file and the Jupyter Notebook will prompt you to paste in your token as input (this is the more common way to input tokens for Ops tools)

## Output
- if everything is setup correctly you should see an output like the following

<div>
    <img src="images/test-output.png" alt="Logo" width="350">
</div>

(instead displaying _your_ first name as it appears on Canvas)

## Getting Started - General Ops Method
1. Make sure you have [your environment created](https://github.com/saud-learning-services/instructions-and-other-templates/blob/main/docs/environment-setup.md) (either universal or project environment)
2. Follow steps to [run Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/saud-learning-services/instructions-and-other-templates/blob/main/docs/running-instructions.md) 
3. Follow the instructions in the Jupyter notebook

**That's it! See below for some more advanced steps if you want to test out your terminal knowledge.**

## Want to Try in Terminal?
> Many of our projects will have instructions similar to the following that are for those who want to run the projects without any GUI. Give it a try if you're keen! 
### First Time (do once)
1. Clone this repo: `$ gh repo clone saud-learning-services/setup-test`
1. Import environment (once): `$ conda env create -f environment.yml`

### Every Time
1. Make sure you are in the right directory: `$ pwd` if it isn't `..../setup-test` then you need to navigate to it: `$ cd {YOUR_PATH}/setup-test`
2. Make sure you have your token (either handy or in .env - see [above](#input))
3. Activate the environment: `$ conda activate setup-test`
4. Launch jupyter: `$ jupyter notebook`
5. Follow instructions
6. You're basically a wizard now üßô‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
